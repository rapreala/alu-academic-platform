# Documentation Standards - Group 31

## Overview

This document defines the documentation standards for Group31_FormativeAssignment1. All code must follow these standards to ensure clarity, maintainability, and professional quality.

---

## File Header Comments

Every Dart file must start with a header comment:

```dart
/// Group 31 - Formative Assignment 1
/// [File Category] - [Specific Purpose]
/// 
/// [Detailed description of what this file contains and its role in the app]
/// [Additional context if needed]
```

**Examples:**

```dart
/// Group 31 - Formative Assignment 1
/// Assignment Model
/// 
/// Defines the Assignment data model with validation logic.
/// Handles serialization to/from Firestore documents.
```

```dart
/// Group 31 - Formative Assignment 1
/// Assignment Service
/// 
/// Provides Firebase Firestore operations for Assignment management.
/// Includes CRUD operations and query methods for assignments.
```

---

## Class Documentation

All classes must have comprehensive doc comments:

```dart
/// [Brief one-line description]
/// 
/// [Detailed explanation of the class purpose]
/// [How it fits into the architecture]
/// [Important usage notes or constraints]
/// 
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// [Code example showing typical usage]
/// ```
class MyClass {
  // Class implementation
}
```

**Example:**

```dart
/// Represents an academic assignment with due date and priority
/// 
/// This model class encapsulates all data related to a student assignment
/// including title, course, due date, priority level, and completion status.
/// It provides methods for Firestore serialization and validation.
/// 
/// The class is immutable - use [copyWith] to create modified copies.
/// 
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// final assignment = Assignment(
///   id: 'abc123',
///   title: 'Math Homework',
///   course: 'Calculus II',
///   dueDate: DateTime.now().add(Duration(days: 7)),
///   priority: PriorityLevel.high,
/// );
/// ```
class Assignment {
  // Implementation
}
```

---

## Method Documentation

All public methods must have doc comments:

```dart
/// [Brief description of what the method does]
/// 
/// [Detailed explanation if needed]
/// [Parameter descriptions]
/// [Return value description]
/// [Exceptions that might be thrown]
/// 
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// [Usage example]
/// ```
ReturnType methodName(parameters) {
  // Implementation
}
```

**Example:**

```dart
/// Creates a new assignment in Firestore
/// 
/// Validates the assignment data before saving. If validation fails,
/// throws a [ValidationException]. On success, returns the document ID
/// of the newly created assignment.
/// 
/// Parameters:
/// - [assignment]: The assignment object to create
/// 
/// Returns: The Firestore document ID of the created assignment
/// 
/// Throws:
/// - [ValidationException] if assignment data is invalid
/// - [FirebaseException] if Firestore operation fails
/// 
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// final id = await service.createAssignment(myAssignment);
/// print('Created assignment with ID: $id');
/// ```
Future<String> createAssignment(Assignment assignment) async {
  // Implementation
}
```

---

## Property Documentation

All public properties should have doc comments:

```dart
/// [Description of what this property represents]
/// 
/// [Additional context, constraints, or usage notes]
final Type propertyName;
```

**Example:**

```dart
/// The unique identifier for this assignment
/// 
/// Generated by Firestore when the assignment is created.
/// Used for all update and delete operations.
final String id;

/// The due date for this assignment
/// 
/// Must be a valid DateTime. Cannot be null.
/// Used for sorting assignments and calculating upcoming assignments.
final DateTime dueDate;

/// Whether this assignment has been completed
/// 
/// Defaults to false when assignment is created.
/// Updated when user marks assignment as complete.
final bool isCompleted;
```

---

## Enum Documentation

Enums should have class-level and value-level documentation:

```dart
/// [Description of what this enum represents]
/// 
/// [List of possible values and their meanings]
enum MyEnum {
  /// [Description of this value]
  value1,
  
  /// [Description of this value]
  value2,
}
```

**Example:**

```dart
/// Priority levels for assignments
/// 
/// Used to categorize assignments by urgency and importance.
/// Affects visual display (color coding) and sorting order.
enum PriorityLevel {
  /// High priority - urgent assignments requiring immediate attention
  /// Displayed in red color
  high,
  
  /// Medium priority - important but not urgent
  /// Displayed in orange/yellow color
  medium,
  
  /// Low priority - can be completed later
  /// Displayed in green color
  low,
}
```

---

## Inline Comments

Use inline comments for complex logic:

```dart
// Calculate attendance percentage
// Formula: (present sessions / total sessions with attendance) × 100
final percentage = (presentCount / totalCount) * 100;

// Ensure end time is after start time
// Convert to minutes for easier comparison
final startMinutes = startTime.hour * 60 + startTime.minute;
final endMinutes = endTime.hour * 60 + endTime.minute;
if (endMinutes <= startMinutes) {
  return 'End time must be after start time';
}
```

---

## TODO Comments

Use TODO comments for future work:

```dart
// TODO: Add support for recurring sessions
// TODO: Implement push notifications for due assignments
// TODO: Replace with custom ALU theme in Task 3
```

---

## Widget Documentation

Widgets should document their purpose and parameters:

```dart
/// [Widget description]
/// 
/// [What it displays and how it behaves]
/// [Important usage notes]
class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  /// [Parameter description]
  final Type parameter;
  
  /// Creates a [MyWidget]
  /// 
  /// [Constructor parameter descriptions]
  const MyWidget({
    super.key,
    required this.parameter,
  });
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

**Example:**

```dart
/// Displays an assignment in a card format
/// 
/// Shows assignment title, course, due date, and priority badge.
/// Includes a checkbox for marking complete and buttons for edit/delete.
/// Uses color coding based on priority level (red/orange/green).
class AssignmentCard extends StatelessWidget {
  /// The assignment to display
  final Assignment assignment;
  
  /// Callback when the completion checkbox is toggled
  final VoidCallback onToggleComplete;
  
  /// Callback when the edit button is pressed
  final VoidCallback onEdit;
  
  /// Callback when the delete button is pressed
  final VoidCallback onDelete;
  
  /// Creates an [AssignmentCard]
  /// 
  /// All parameters are required to ensure proper functionality.
  const AssignmentCard({
    super.key,
    required this.assignment,
    required this.onToggleComplete,
    required this.onEdit,
    required this.onDelete,
  });
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

---

## Provider Documentation

Providers should document state and methods:

```dart
/// [Provider description]
/// 
/// Manages state for [feature] and provides methods for [operations].
/// Notifies listeners when state changes.
/// 
/// Usage:
/// ```dart
/// [Usage example with Consumer or Provider.of]
/// ```
class MyProvider extends ChangeNotifier {
  // Private state
  List<Type> _items = [];
  bool _isLoading = false;
  String? _error;
  
  // Public getters
  /// [Getter description]
  List<Type> get items => _items;
  
  /// [Getter description]
  bool get isLoading => _isLoading;
  
  /// [Getter description]
  String? get error => _error;
  
  // Methods with documentation
}
```

---

## Service Documentation

Services should document their purpose and all methods:

```dart
/// [Service description]
/// 
/// Provides [operations] for [entity] using Firebase Firestore.
/// Handles error cases and data transformation.
/// 
/// All methods are asynchronous and may throw [FirebaseException].
class MyService {
  /// The Firestore instance used for database operations
  final FirebaseFirestore _firestore;
  
  /// The name of the Firestore collection
  final String _collection = 'collection_name';
  
  /// Creates a [MyService]
  /// 
  /// Optionally accepts a custom [FirebaseFirestore] instance for testing.
  MyService({FirebaseFirestore? firestore})
      : _firestore = firestore ?? FirebaseFirestore.instance;
  
  // Methods with full documentation
}
```

---

## Validation Documentation

Validators should document rules and return values:

```dart
/// Validates [field] according to [rules]
/// 
/// Returns null if valid, or an error message string if invalid.
/// 
/// Validation rules:
/// - [Rule 1]
/// - [Rule 2]
/// - [Rule 3]
/// 
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// final error = validateTitle('My Title');
/// if (error != null) {
///   print('Validation failed: $error');
/// }
/// ```
static String? validateField(Type? value) {
  // Implementation
}
```

## Best Practices

### DO:
✅ Write documentation before or while writing code  
✅ Use complete sentences with proper grammar  
✅ Include examples for complex APIs  
✅ Document all public members  
✅ Explain WHY, not just WHAT  
✅ Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes  

### DON'T:
❌ State the obvious (e.g., "// This is a variable")  
❌ Leave outdated documentation  
❌ Document private implementation details excessively  
❌ Use vague descriptions like "handles stuff"  
❌ Forget to document parameters and return values
